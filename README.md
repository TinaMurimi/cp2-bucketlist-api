2. SQLite3

# How should this be manually tested?

**Prepare virtual environment**
* To install virtualenvwrapper, we will first install virtualenv

        $ pip install virtualenv
        $ pip install virtualenvwrapper

* Next, create a folder that will contain all your virtual environments:

        $ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs

* Open your .bashrc file and add:

        $ export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
        $ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

* You can activate these changes by typing

        $ source .bashrc

* Quit the current terminal and reopen it to execute the script and start working with virtualenvwrapper.

* To create a virtual environment

        $ mkvirtualenv --python=python3_path <environment_name>

* python3_path is the path of python3, which can be found with

        $ which python3

* To activate a virtual environment

        $ workon <environment_name>

* To deactivate it, just type:

        $ deactivate

* To delete a virtual environment

        $ rmvirtualenv <environment_name>

**Check out the project**

        $ git clone https://github.com/tinamorale/cp1-amity-allocation/

**Install requirements into virtualenvwrapper:**

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

**To run the application**

        $ python main.py

**To run the test**
* Create a .coveragerc file

        $ touch .coveragerc

* Add the files you do not want covered. Eg.:
     ```
     [run]
     omit =
         psycopg2.py
         */psycopg2/*
         sqlalchemy.py
         */sqlalchemy/*
         *decimal.py
         *numbers.py
         sqlite3.py
         */sqlite3/*
         *tabulate.py
     ```

* Run the test:

        $ nosetests

* To check the coverage

        $ nosetests --with-coverage
